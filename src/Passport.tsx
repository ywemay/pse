      <h1>Passport of human of planet earth.</h1>

      <p>The passport of human of planet earth is a computer file that contains data about a human. Most of the information that is contained in the passport file is encrypted and can be revealed only with the password provided by the human that holds this passport.</p>

      <p>The fact that your passport is a computer file allows it to be stored anywhere in the internet, as well as on your phone, your computer or portable storage devices.</p>

      <p>Except personal data passports contain declarations that human, passport holder, adhere to.</p>

      <p>The date when the passport was created is present in the passport file. And it serves as one of a key future to verify its partial validity. </p>

      <p>It's understandable that such type of passport may be easily corrupt and misused: Any human can create multiple passports or use software robots to bulk generate passports like that. Thus the final confirmation of the passport will be the actions that human take. His engagement in social projects. Participation to the emerging democracy activity.</p>

      <p>Once the file of the passport is completed by the human the check sum of the file is calculated. If human decides to change his information in the passport.A new check sum is calculated, and the word one is included in the file.</p>

      <p>The check sums, along with other data, are used to identify the human participation to emergent democracy activity/project.</p>
