      <h1>Emergent Democracy</h1>
      <p>
        Emergent democracy is the process of auto administration of society In which humans vote openly 24/24 on a project provided by a entity, a human or a management system system. Of course, humans choose at their will to participate or not to certain project. And even voters that already placed their vote - can change or cancel it at any point in time.
        </p>

      <p>
        To achieve this level of flexibility, voting is done online by using human earth passports. The human or the entity/company that created the project is responsible to provide such capability. They also decide what information they want to collect and how voting is done. This allows the initiator of the project to gather initial information about the will of the people.  The end result of this activity is envisioned to be a group action taken by all voters together.  Such actions can be:
        <ul>
          <li>sending bulk paper letters to a certain institution by all voters at once</li>
          <li>organizing protests</li>
          <li>ignoring orders/taxes</li>
          <li>creating communities</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
